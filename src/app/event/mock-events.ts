  { id: 12, name: 'IBM & Instana: Road to Enterprise Observability - Immediate Insight (Part 1)',date:'20.09.2021',description: 'As distributed systems grow bigger they become more complex and harder to manage. The amount of data generated by these microservices-based applications is more than any human, or even group of humans can process on their own. Because of this, AIOps is essential for proper management of all the Observability data points. To prevent metric overload, we need to look into the benefits of and importance of Observability.In this exclusive webinar, designed by IBM Developer and Instana, we will discuss the key differences between (simple) monitoring and (enterprise) observability and dive deeper into the questions and answers, to be answered by the observability insights from our microservices-based application.This session will touch on the three pillars of Observability – Health / Performance Metrics, (Distributed) Traces, and Logs, and we will also have a hands-on perspective of the data automatically captured into the Instana platform.In this webinar attendees will learn about:Key concepts and value of (Enterprise) Observability Introduction to Observability-Driven Development Insights to be gained from Distributed Traces on the Instana platform How to apply Observability into your development lifecycle Prerequisites: A free IBM Cloud Account: https://ibm.biz/BdfPq7 Crowdcast registration page: https://www.crowdcast.io/e/instana-observability/register Speakers: Chris Engelbert – Instana Developer Advocate Max Shapiro – IBM Developer Advocate Pooja Mistry – IBM Developer Advocate', topic: 'programming',duration: '2 h',picture: './assets/Screenshot 2021-07-07 at 09.49.36.png',location: 'string',rsvp_limit: 3,open_register_time: 'string',close_register_time: 'string',has_fee: false,fee: 0, time: "19:30", is_online: true, link_meeting: "zoom", groups:["IBM Developer Romania, IBM Developer Bulgaria"] },
  { id: 13, name: 'IBM & Instana: Road to Enterprise Observability - Immediate Insight (Part 2)',date:'7.10.2021', description: 'In the last session IBM & Instana Present: Road to Enterprise Observability we were introduced to the value of Observability. In this exclusive session, by IBM Developer and Turbonomic, we will dive deep into Observability related to application performance. As cloud deployments become more complex, tooling to manage application performance and infrastructure becomes more critical. To address this need, Turbonomic created an (Application Resource Management) ARM tool that helps operators understand and manage cloud infrastructure to reduce operating expenses and improve cloud performance. In this session, designed by IBM Developer and Turbonomic, we will go on a technical deep dive to highlight how AIOps provides highly distributed and dynamic applications the resources they need to perform with ARM. AIOps is the cross-section of Observability and actionability, which helps customers automate to focus on innovation and deliver the best customer experiences. In this webinar, attendees will learn about : Key concepts and value of AIOps How ARM brings higher levels of automation to APM (Application Performance Monitoring) solutions such as Instana through AIOps  How Turbonomic Platform works together with Instana platform to monitor and manage OpenShift deployments Prerequisites:  A free IBM Cloud Account: https://ibm.biz/BdfyPa Crowdcast registration page: https://www.crowdcast.io/e/turbonomic-performance/register Speakers:  Eric Wright - Technology Evangelist at Turbonomic Max Shapiro - IBM Developer Advocate  Pooja Mistry - IBM Developer Advocate', topic: 'programming',duration: '2 h',picture: './assets/Screenshot 2021-07-07 at 09.49.52.png',location: 'string',rsvp_limit: 3,open_register_time: 'string',close_register_time: 'string',has_fee: false,fee: 0, time: "19:30", is_online: true, link_meeting: "zoom", groups:["IBM Developer Romania, IBM Developer Bulgaria"] },
